      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>There’s something about creating that I have always enjoyed. I studied music in school, which involved composing musical pieces. I found this to be a pleasant challenge. I also worked for years as a handyman. This  often involved identifying an existing problem and repairing it or building a new project. Planning and completing a project was extremely satisfying.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Software development allows me to do all of this. Whether I’m working on existing code or creating”my own project, I can “build” an idea, planning out the structure and necessary steps to complete it. Then I can “compose” code, making sure all the parts work together harmoniously to create a beautiful experience.</p>
