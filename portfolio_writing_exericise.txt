I studied music in school This involved composing pieces, which I find to be an enjoyable challenge. I also worked for years as a handyman. This  often involved identifying an existing problem and repairing it or building a new project, which I find extremely satisfying. Software development allows me to do all of these. Whether I’m working on existing code or “creating” my own project, I can compose code that creates a beautiful experience.
